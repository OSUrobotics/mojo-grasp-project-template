# mojo-grasp-project-template
Template for mojo-grasp projects.

Not all template classes should or need to be used. Mojo-grasp defaults should work a majority of the time, but classes like phase and environment
will need to be changed for every project. Only write your own if you need functionality that a default does not offer.
